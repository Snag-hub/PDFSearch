## Features

- üîç Full-text PDF search across multiple files
- üìÇ Directory-based indexing
- üöÄ Parallel processing for fast indexing
- üìÑ Page-level search results
- üñ•Ô∏è Easy-to-use Windows Forms interface
- üíæ Persistent indexing with metadata tracking

## Prerequisites

- Windows OS
- .NET Framework
- Adobe Acrobat Reader (recommended, but optional)

## Dependencies

- Lucene.Net (v4.8)
- System.Text.Json
- Windows Forms

## Key Components

### LuceneIndexer
- Manages PDF file indexing
- Stores indexes in the user's local application data
- Supports parallel processing
- Tracks file modifications to optimize re-indexing

### LuceneSearcher
- Performs full-text searches across indexed PDFs
- Returns page-level search results
- Uses Lucene.NET's advanced search capabilities

### Notable Features

- Unique index folder generation using SHA256 hashing
- Metadata tracking to avoid re-indexing unchanged files
- Thread-safe indexing and metadata updates
- Error handling and logging

## Configuration

- Index storage location: `%LocalAppData%\No1Knows\Index`
- PDF viewer: Defaults to Adobe Acrobat, falls back to system default

## Performance Considerations

- Initial indexing might take time depending on the number and size of PDFs
- Subsequent searches are very fast due to pre-built indexes
- Parallel processing helps speed up initial indexing

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure PDF files are readable and not password-protected
- Check console output for detailed indexing and search logs
- Use "Clean Indexes" button if you encounter persistent issues
